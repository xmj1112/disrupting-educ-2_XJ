d 'ESTOUT': module to make regression tables
d 
d  estout produces a table of regression results from one or
d several models for use with spreadsheets, LaTeX, HTML, or a
d word-processor table. eststo stores a quick copy of the active
d estimation results for later tabulation. esttab is a wrapper for
d estout. It displays a pretty looking publication-style regression
d table without much typing. estadd adds additional results to the
d e()-returns for one or several models previously fitted and
d stored. This package subsumes the previously circulated esto,
d esta, estadd,  and estadd_plus. An earlier version of estout is
d available  as estout1.

d 'IVREG2': module for extended instrumental variables/2SLS and GMM estimation
d 
d  ivreg2 provides extensions to Stata's official ivregress and
d newey. Its main capabilities: two-step feasible GMM estimation;
d continuously updated GMM estimation (CUE); LIML and k-class
d estimation; automatic output of the Hansen-Sargan or
d Anderson-Rubin statistic for overidentifying restrictions; C
d statistic test of exogeneity of subsets of instruments (orthog()
d option); kernel-based autocorrelation-consistent (AC) and
d heteroskedastic and autocorrelation-consistent (HAC) estimation,
d with user-specified choice of kernel; Cragg's "heteroskedastic
d OLS" (HOLS) estimator; default reporting of large-sample
d statistics (z and chi-squared rather than t and F); small option
d to report small-sample statistics; first-stage regression
d reported with F-test of excluded instruments and R-squared with
d included instruments "partialled-out"; enhanced Kleibergen-Paap
d and Cragg-Donald tests for weak instruments, redundancy of
d instruments, significance of endogenous regressors; two-way
d clustering of standard errors;  Kiefer and Driscoll-Kraay
d standard errors. ivreg2 can also be used for ordinary least
d squares (OLS) estimation using the same command syntax as Stata's
d official regress and newey. New in this version: ivreg2 now
d supports factor variables. This is version 4.1.11 of ivreg2,
d updated from that published in Stata Journal, 5(4), requiring
d Stata 11.2 or better. Stata 8.2/9.2/10.2 users may use this
d routine, which will  automatically call ivreg28, ivreg29, or
d ivreg210, respectively. These versions are now included in the
d ivreg2 package. Stata 7 users may use the Stata Journal version
d of ivreg2, accessible via net search ivreg2.

d 'RANKTEST': module to test the rank of a matrix
d 
d  ranktest implements various tests for the rank of a matrix.
d Tests of the rank of a matrix have many practical applications.
d For example, in econometrics the requirement for identification
d is the rank condition, which states that a particular matrix must
d be of full column rank. Another example from econometrics
d concerns cointegration in vector autoregressive (VAR) models; the
d Johansen trace test is a test of a rank of a particular matrix.
d The traditional test of the rank of a matrix for the standard
d (stationary) case is the Anderson (1951) canonical correlations
d test. If we denote one list of variables as Y and a second as Z,
d and we calculate the squared canonical correlations between Y and
d Z, the LM form of the Anderson test, where the null hypothesis is
d that the matrix of correlations or regression parameters B
d between Y and Z has rank(B)=r, is N times the sum of the r+1
d largest squared canonical correlations. A large test statistic
d and rejection of the null indicates that the matrix has rank at
d least r+1. The Cragg-Donald (1993) statistic is a closely related
d Wald test for the rank of a matrix. The standard versions of
d these tests require the assumption that the covariance matrix has
d a Kronecker form; when this is not so, e.g., when disturbances
d are heteroskedastic or autocorrelated, the test statistics are no
d longer valid. ranktest implements various generalizations of
d these tests - Kleibergen-Paap, Cragg-Donald, and J-type 2-step
d GMM and CUE GMM tests - to the case of a non-Kronecker covariance
d matrix. The implementation in ranktest will calculate test
d statistics that are robust to various forms of
d heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation, and clustering.

d 'LEEBOUNDS': module for estimating Lee (2009) treatment effect bounds
d 
d  leebounds computes treatment effect bounds for samples with
d non-random sample selection/attrition as proposed by Lee (Review
d of Economic Studies, 2009). The lower and    upper bound,
d respectively, correspond to extreme assumptions about the missing
d information that are consistent with the observed data. As
d opposed to parametric approaches to correcting for sample
d selection bias, such as the classical Heckman (1979) estimator,
d Lee (2009) bounds rest on very few assumptions, i.e. random
d assignment of treatment and monotonicity. Monotonicity means that
d the treatment status affects selection in just one direction.
d That is, receiving a treatment makes selection either more or
d less likely for any observation. In technical terms, the approach
d rests on a trimming procedure. Either from below or from
d above, the group (treatment, control) that suffers less from
d sample attrition is trimmed at the quantile of the outcome
d variable that corresponds to the share of 'excess observations'
d in this group. Calculating group differentials in mean    outcome
d yields the lower and the upper bound, respectively, for the
d treatment effect depending on whether trimming is from below or
d above.  leebounds    assumes that it is unknown, a priori, which
d group (treatment, control) is subject to the higher selection
d probability and estimates this from data    (see Lee, 2009:1090). d
